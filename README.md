# Project Overview
With the boom of AI the financial industry is experiencing interesting changes and improvements. Many companies are starting to integrate [Machine Learning in their businesses](https://towardsdatascience.com/the-growing-impact-of-ai-in-financial-services-six-examples-da386c0301b2). Fraud prevention, risk management, portfolio management, investment prediction, process automation, are some of the applications of ML in finance. The Stock Market and Algorithmic Trading are other areas benefiting from it. Traders are embracing some of the new techniques and algorithms to improve their performance.

Time series forecasting has become a [hot topic](https://eu.udacity.com/course/time-series-forecasting--ud980) with the advances in Machine Learning. [Time series analysis and predictions](http://www.statsoft.com/Textbook/Time-Series-Analysis) is one of the oldest and most applied data science techniques in finance, but [new ones](https://www.xenonstack.com/blog/time-series-forecasting-machine-deep-learning/) are emerging, more [sophisticated and powerful](https://medium.com/neuronio/predicting-stock-prices-with-lstm-349f5a0974d4), providing with more accuracy, using the power of Deep Learning... But before we start rubbing our hands in glee and greediness thinking we can all use these algorithms to easily get rich, I need to warn you: Stock market prices are highly unpredictable and volatile. There are no consistent patterns in the data that would allow you to model stock prices over time. Princeton University economist Burton Malkiel wrote in his 1973 book, “A Random Walk Down Wall Street”, that “[A blindfolded monkey](https://www.forbes.com/sites/rickferri/2012/12/20/any-monkey-can-beat-the-market) throwing darts at a newspaper's financial pages could select a portfolio that would do just as well as one carefully selected by experts.”
